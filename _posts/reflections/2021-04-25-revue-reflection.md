## My goals for uni

I started uni this year with a few different goals in mind:
- [ ] Either continue cross-country running or try out a new sport
- [ ] Sign up something completely new
- [ ] Go to as many events as possible!!!


## Finding out about Revue

Two days into uni someone convinced me to check out a society called Med Revue. I felt so out of place because I had never tried dancing before. As I watched everyone learning really easily while I struggled on the most simple moves, I realised that dancing wasn't for me. The commitment was huge as well; rehearsals added up to over 15 hours a week and I had a full uni workload on top of that.

I decided to come back the next day and stay for the entire rehearsal to give revue a fair chance because learning dancing seemed interesting and I didn't want to say no until I had stayed to try out the acting. After every rehearsal for the next few days, I convinced myself that I'd check out the next one and within a week I felt completely integrated into the society.

Revue is so much more than simply a comedy-sketch show: it's a group of friends working together to learn new skills and have fun. Learning how to dance went from a tedious task to an exciting opportunity. The choreos were so encouraging that every time I got home after a rehearsal, I *wanted* to keep practicing instead of going to sleep.
