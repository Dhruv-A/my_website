title: Online Learning at Uni

Since about week 4 of term 2, uni has been completely online. My experience as a first year was unique because I had a period of online high school in 2020 and so I had some ideas for how lockdown would turn out. I expected lockdown to be:

1. Very short (I initially hoped that it would only last 2-3 weeks)
2. Not very productive academically (There were so many problems with online uni when I first started - exams were crashing, the COVID situation was poorly communicated and all in-person society events were completely cancelled)
3. Really good for trying to put more time into the societies I was a part of (I had just become the secretary and treasurer of [Med Revue](https://dhruvagrawal.org/reflections/revue-reflection/) and I was excited to be able to put more time into this and the other activities I had)

## The COVID Situation

One of the most expected things for me this year was the 2nd wave of COVID. Living in Australia, the first wave was barely noticeable and by the time vaccines had become approved in many countries, I assumed that COVID would be completely gone in a few months. Looking at the logistics behind distributing a handful of vaccines to the entire world before a mutation like delta sprung up on the population, it was naive to assume that was the end.

In June, we started getting a few cases in the state and although it only started off with a few a day, the power of [exponential growth](https://dhruvagrawal.org/posts/graphing-covid/) led to cases climbing rapidly. One of the biggest mistakes during the delta wave was not going into lockdown fast enough. Although it seems like a few cases are trivial, even one case can cause the entire state to go into lockdown in a matter of weeks.
