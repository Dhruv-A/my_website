I use this website to post random items I'm working on and talk about my past experiences. You can find source code for this [here](https://github.com/Dhruv-A/my_website).

[Onecore](https://onecore.tech) is a project I created in 2020 to teach students coding for the first time. If you wish to learn coding, make sure to check it out! I plan to revamp the website design in the future and continue adding more courses!
